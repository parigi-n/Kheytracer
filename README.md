School project made at EPITECH at the end of first year.
It's a simple homemade raytracer in C. The only lib used is "minilibx", a quick-and-dirty lib made by EPITECH that is only used to make a window and write the image in it.
It have a little bash-like interface with a parser/writer to find scenes, load them and modify them.

Authors :

- Jules VAUTIER https://github.com/JulesVautier for the raytracer engine
- Nicolas PARIGI https://github.com/david-sebaoun the parser/writer and syntax of ".khey" files
- David SEBAOUN https://github.com/parigi-n for the bash-like interface
- Oscar, for ... well i don't know
